# CIS 350 - Student Presentation Assignment

One of my main goals for you in this course is to come away with an increased awareness and appreciation for not only the methods and techniques used by both bad actors and cybersecurity professionals, but also how cybersecurity impacts everyone every day. The Presentation assignment gives you a chance to explore a current event, issue or technical topic in cybersecurity and present your findings to your classmates. 

Each student in this course will deliver one (1) presentation during the semester. 

## Signup Process

To avoid overlap, you will sign up for a presentation topic using the [CIS350 Signup Website](https://cis350.cs.campus-quest.com) at <https://cis350.cs.campus-quest.com>. On the site, you will provide:

* Your StarID - The site is aware of who is enrolled in the course; only enrolled students may submit a reservation
* Which date you would like to present on. A limited number of presentation slots are available per day and will update in real-time as your classmates sign up.

   > Presentations will begin on Monday, October 7th and will occur on every Monday and Wednesday through the Monday of Thanksgiving week.

* A short description of your topic. This should be a one-line description that clearly identifies the specific topic you are covering. Good examples include "National Public Data Breach - Implications for Privacy" or "CrowdStrike - Why it took down large companies". 

   > Be concise but specific. "Data breach" is far too insufficient. 

* A **primary reference**. This could be a website URL, a podcast (provide link and time index if it's a long podcast), a YouTube video, etc.

   > Note that you don't need to - nor should you - limit yourself to one source. Use as many sources as you find necessary and appropriate for your topic!
   >
   > Please include a References slide in your presentation - you don't need to do proper academic citation, but enough information to identify your source(s) should be present.

* Optional extra details on your topic. This isn't necessary, but it would be helpful to help you and others ensure there is no topic overlap. Enter as much or as little information as you need here to ensure your topic is clear.

**Before you sign up**, review any existing submissions on the website to make sure nobody else is already presenting on your topic. The website is first-come-first-serve - if you post a topic first, it's yours. 

If you post a topic that is not acceptable for the assignment, I'll contact you privately and directly with advice. If you post a topic that is the same as another topic already listed I will remove your submission and alert you that you need to sign up again with a different topic.

> *Important*: The website only allows you to sign up *once*. If you try to sign up again, your first submission will **not** be replaced. If you have made an error in submitting, please contact me via E-mail and I'll either adjust your submission or remove it so that you may signup again.

## Presentation Requirements

* Your presentation should be a **minimum** of 10 minutes in length, and no more than 20 minutes in length.
* You may format your presentation in any way you feel appropriate and comfortable with. If applicable you may include live demonstrations or short clips of videos. You are not required to use PowerPoint if you prefer a different presentation tool, as long as you can present it to the class. 
* Your presentation's contents will partly depend on your specific topic, but in general all presentations must include the following:
  * A brief concise introduction to your topic
  * Technical details as necessary for others in class to understand your topic
  * Practical implications - both technical and non-technical. Again, this will vary depending on your topic - for example, if you are presenting on a recent breach, specific advice based on that breach's circumstances would be appropriate; if you are presenting on a technical topic such as a specific attack method or research area, advice to users on mitigation of any threat is appropriate. You will often need to synthesize this advice on your own!
  * A final slide for allowing the class to ask you questions

## Topics

You may be wondering exactly what is acceptable as a topic. In general, a topic should be specific but not so specific that there is very little to say on it.

Large events, such as the CrowdStrike incident, can make up multiple presentations - one might include a technical breakdown as to exactly what happened and advice for software developers, while another might explore how the breach impacted large corporations and advice for those corporations to prevent or minimize impact from a similar event, while still another might include a discussion on how the incident affected everyday individuals and what advice might help individuals deal with the fallout of the incident.

Please avoid "low-hanging fruit" such as "another routine data breach". If you are going to cover a data breach, try to find one that has a particularly unique or interesting aspect to it. For example, a data breach based on a simple phishing attack would be "low-hanging fruit" since these breaches are unfortunately quite common. However, a breach that involved an especially novel or clever method of infiltration would be appropriate, especially since you may be able to give some unique advice to both organizations and individuals.

You may also choose to cover a technical topic, such as research into a novel way of attacking or infiltrating a secure system or network. In this case, the advice section should include a discussion on how the attack strategy might be used to attack a person and what a person might be able to do to try to mitigate or minimize negative impact.

There is always a ton of interesting developments happening in cybersecurity, so I do not anticipate you'll have trouble finding a unique topic, However, if you are completely stuck and unsure of a topic, please contact me and I'll give you some ideas.

## Scoring Rubric

| Item | Points | Penalties |
|-|-|-|
| Presentation includes detailed information on a recent,, current cybersecurity topic (generally less than 3 months old, exceptions may be made for especially important events) | 30 | Variable point loss depending on adherence to requirement. |
| Technical content is accurate and well researched. | 20 | 4 points lost per vulnerability without strategies for mitigation. Minimum score for this item is 0. |
| Presentation includes actionable or useful advice for everyone or for specific audiences and types of people | 20 | Variable point loss depending on adherence to requirement. |
| Presentation is well designed with correct spelling, grammar, appropriate language and good form. Appropriate use of visual aids if applicable | 20 | Point loss depends on severity of errors. |
| Verbal delivery of presentation was clear and professional | 10 | Obvious evidence of poor preparation will result in loss of points.
